If the problem is to make a list of the cubes of a sequence of numbers, you want a list accumulation, starting with an empty list and appending one more cube each time. If the problem is to make a comma-separated list of all the people invited to a party, you should think concatenation; you could start with an empty string and concatenate one more person on each iteration through a list of names."

    "### Before Writing it\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* What sequence will you iterate through as you accumulate a result? It could be a range of numbers, the letters in a string, or some existing list that you have just as a list of names.\n",
    "* What type of value will you accumulate? If your final result is to be a number, your accumulator will start out with a number and always have a number even as it is updated each time. Similarly, if your final result is to be a list, start with a list. If your final result is to be a string, you’ll probably want to start with a string; one other option is to accumulate a list of strings and then use the `.join()` method at the end to concatenate them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend writing your answers to these questions in a comment. As you encounter bugs and have to look things up, it will help remind you what it was you were trying to implement. Sometimes just writing the comment can help you spot a potential problem and avoid it before you ever write any code."

    "### Choosing Good Accumulator and Iterator Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "One final piece of advice regarding accumulation strategies is to be intentional when choosing variable names for the accumulator and iterator variables. A good name can help remind you of what the value assigned to the variable is, as well as what you should end up with at the end of your code. While it might be tempting at first to use a short variable name, such as `a` or `x`, if you run into any bugs or look at your code later, you may have trouble understanding what you intended to do and what your code is actually doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the accumulator variable, one thing that can help is to make the variable name end with “so_far”. The prefix can be chosen to help remind you of what you’re supposed to end up with. For example: count_so_far, total_so_far, or cubes_so_far.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously the iterator variable should be a singular noun. It should describe what one item in the original sequence is, not what one item in the final result will be. For example, when accumulating cubes of numbers from 1-25, don’t write\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for cube in range(25):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instead, write \n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(25):\n",
    "```    \n",
    "If you name the iterator variable `cube` you run the risk of getting confused that it has already been cubed, when that’s actually something you have still to write in your code.

What the `sorted` function does is call that `key` function once for each item in the list that’s getting sorted. It associates the result returned by that function (the `absolute` function in our case) with the original value. Think of those associated values as being post-it notes that decorate the original values. The value 4 has a post-it that says 4 on it, but the value -2 has a post-it that says 2 on it.

We could have passed just the key, but then the function would have to look up the value, and it would be a little confusing, from the code, to figure out what dictionary the key is supposed to be looked up in.
