    "If you have installed Python on your computer (by now you will have) and you are trying to get file reading and writing operations to work, there’s a little more that you may need to understand. Computer operating systems (like Windows and Mac OS) organise files into a hierarchy of folders (aka directories), with some folders containing other folders.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If your file and your Python program are in the same directory you can simply use the filename. For example, with the file hierarchy in the diagram, the file `myPythonProgram.py` could contain the code `open('data1.txt','r')` and there will be no issues because the Python program and the file it wishes to read, `data1.text` are in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file you wish to read and your Python program are in different directories, however, then you need to specify a **path**. You can think of the filename as the short name for a file, and the path as the full name (see Figure 1 above). Typically, you will specify a *relative* file path, which provides instructions on where to find the file you wish to read, relative to the directory where the code is running from. For example, the program `myPythonProgram.py` could contain the code `open('../myData/data2.txt','r')`. The `../` means to go up one level in the directory structure, to the containing folder `allProjects`; then `myData/` gives instructions to descend into the `myData` subfolder where the file `data2.txt` is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an option to use an *absolute* file path. For example, suppose the file structure in Figure 2 is stored on a computer in the user’s home directory,`/Users/joebloggs/myFiles`. Then code in any Python program running from *any* file folder could open `data2.txt` via `open('/Users/joebloggs/myFiles/allProjects/myData/data2.txt','r')`. You can tell an absolute file path because it begins with a `/`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were ever to move your programs and data to another computer, it will be much more convenient if you use relative file paths rather than absolute. That way, if you preserve the folder structure when moving everything, you won’t need to change your code. If you use absolute paths, then the account on the other computer will probably not have the same home directory name, it may be `/Users/janebloggs` for instance. Note that Python pathnames follow the UNIX conventions (Mac OS is a UNIX variant), rather than the Windows file pathnames that use `:` and `‘’`. The Python interpreter will translate to Windows pathnames when running on a Windows machine; you should be able to share your Python program between a Windows machine and a MAC without having to rewrite the file `open` commands."

    "One of the most commonly performed data processing tasks is to read data from a file, manipulate it in some way, and then write the resulting data out to a new data file to be used for other purposes later. To accomplish this, the `open` function discussed above can also be used to create a new file prepared for writing. Note in Table 1 that the only difference between opening a file for writing and opening a file for reading is the use of the `'w'` flag instead of the `'r'` flag as the second parameter. When we open a file for writing, a new, empty file with that name is created and made ready to accept our data. If an existing file has the same name, its contents are overwritten. As before, the `open` function returns a reference to the new file object.\n",

    "Table 2 shows one additional method on file objects that we have not used thus far. The `write` method allows us to add data to a text file. Recall that text files contain sequences of characters. We usually think of these character sequences as being the lines of the file where each line ends with the newline `\\n` character. Be very careful to notice that the `write` method takes one parameter, a string. When invoked, the characters of the string will be added to the end of the file. This means that it is the programmer’s job to include the newline characters as part of the string if desired.\n",

    "There are a few things worth noting in the code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, using `.format()` makes it nice and clear what we’re doing when we create the variable `row_string`. We are making a comma separated set of values; the {} curly brackets indicate where to substitute the actual values. The equivalent string concatenation would be hard to read. An alternative, also clear way to do it would be with the `join` method: `row_string = ','.join(customer[0], customer[1], customer[2])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, unlike the `print` function, remember that the `write` method on a file object does not automatically insert a newline. Instead, we have to explicitly add the character `\\n` at the end of each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we must explicitly refer to each of the elements of `customer` when building the string to write. Note that just putting `.format(customer)` wouldn’t work because the interpreter would see only one value (a tuple) when it was expecting three values to try to substitute into the string template. In the previous notebook [Sequences II](01.14-Sequences-II.ipynb) we saw that Python provides an advanced technique for automatically unpacking the three values from the tuple, with `.format(*customer)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described previously, if one or more columns contain text, and that text could contain commas, we need to do something to distinguish a comma in the text from a comma that is separating different values (cells in the table). If we want to enclose each value in double quotes, it can start to get a little tricky, because we would need to have the double quote character `\" \"` inside the string output. Though it is doable. Indeed, one reason Python allows strings to be delimited with either single quotes or double quotes is so that one can be used to delimit the string and the other can be a character in the string. If you get to the point where you need to quote all of the values, I recommend learning to use Python’s csv module."
