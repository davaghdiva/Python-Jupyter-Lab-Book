Brian Gerard O'Driscoll (born 21 January 1979) is a retired Irish professional rugby union player. 
He played at outside centre for the Irish provincial team Leinster and for Ireland. He captained Ireland from 2003 until 2012, 
and captained the British and Irish Lions for their 2005 tour of New Zealand. He is regarded by critics as one of the greatest rugby players of all time.[1][2]
O'Driscoll is the second most-capped player in rugby union history, having played 141 test matches: 133 for Ireland (83 as captain), 
and 8 for the British and Irish Lions.[1][3] He scored 46 tries for Ireland and 1 try for the Lions in 2001, making him the highest try scorer of all time in Irish Rugby.[1][4] 
He is the 8th-highest try scorer in international rugby union history, and the highest scoring centre of all time.
O'Driscoll holds the Six Nations record for most tries scored with 26.[5][6] He has scored the most Heineken Cup tries (30) by an Irishman.[7]
O'Driscoll was chosen as Player of the Tournament in the 2006, 2007 and 2009 Six Nations Championships.[8]
He was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame on 17 November 2016 at the opening ceremony for the Hall's first location in Rugby, Warwickshire.[9]
O'Driscoll was involved in Irish Rugby's unsuccessful bid to hold the 2023 World Cup.[10] He now works as a rugby analyst for BT Sport and ITV Sport in the United Kingdom.
O'Driscoll was born in Dublin to Frank and Geraldine O'Driscoll, both physicians.[11] 
O'Driscoll's family was steeped in rugby. His father, Frank, played two games for Ireland and a cousin of his father, Barry, won four caps.[12] 
However it was another cousin of Frank's, Barry's brother John, who really put the O'Driscoll name on the map: 
he represented Ireland 26 times and was a member of the Lions side that toured 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa and 1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand.[12][13][13]
As a child, Brian played Gaelic football before switching to rugby.[14] For his secondary education, 
he attended Blackrock College, where he played in the Senior Cup team in 1996 and 1997 after coming up through the ranks from the lower-level teams.[14]
Although O'Driscoll started the first two rounds of the competition in 1996, he was subsequently dropped to the bench for the remainder of the competition, 
and was an unused replacement in the team's victorious final appearance, in which Leo Cullen and Bob Casey were the second row. 
In 1997 they were beaten in the quarter-final by Clongowes, who had Gordon D'Arcy in their side.[15] He was capped three times for Ireland Schools in 1996.[16][17]
In 1998, O'Driscoll played for the Ireland U-19 side, which won the Under 19 Rugby World Championship. 
After leaving school, he attended UCD on a scholarship.[18] At UCD, he first made the under-20 side, before being promoted to the top team near the end of his first year.[18] 
After two years, O'Driscoll graduated from UCD with a diploma in sports management.[18] While at UCD, his coach John McClean moved O'Driscoll from the fly-half position to centre. 
O'Driscoll made his Ireland under-21 debut in February 1999, and eventually gained four caps.[17]
Leinster appointed Michael Cheika in the summer of 2005 and despite rumours of O'Driscoll moving to France, O'Driscoll agreed to another year in Ireland. 
That year, O'Driscoll returning from a shoulder injury suffered on the Lions tour, would assume the captaincy for the season. 
Under backs coach David Knox and the movement of Argentine international Felipe Contepomi to fly half, the Leinster back line became one of the most potent in Europe.[20]
O'Driscoll excelled in wins over Bath Rugby and Toulouse away from home. 
These victories would set up an Heineken Cup semi-final in Lansdowne Road against Munster, but defeat against the eventual champions Munster would deny O'Driscoll and his team a final berth. 
Leinster were also denied a Magners League title, with David Humphreys of Ulster slotting an injury time drop goal to give victory to Ulster in their final game of the season.[21]
In 2007, Wasps beat Leinster in the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup. In 2008, Leinster lost in the group stages. 
In 2007, Leinster reached the final hurdle of the Magners league only to be denied by the Ospreys and Cardiff. 
In 2008, Leinster won that title ahead of Munster, marking O'Driscoll's second honour with the province, his first and only as captain.[citation needed]
The 2008–09 season marked a shift in focus for O'Driscoll. While retaining the Irish captaincy under new coach Declan Kidney, he handed the honour of Leinster captain to Leo Cullen. 
O'Driscoll scored two tries in the defeat of English champions London Wasps, however this victory was followed by away defeats for Leinster to both London Wasps and Castres. 
Leinster advanced to the quarter-finals to face Harlequins at the Twickenham Stoop. 
When O'Driscoll was absent through injury in April 2009, Leinster relinquished their Magners League crown to Munster at Thomond Park. 
Against Harlequins, Leinster scored a 6–5 victory, the game infamous for the Bloodgate incident.
In the semi-final against rivals Munster in Croke Park, an 82,206 sell out, 
O'Driscoll was awarded the man of the match award (which he later dedicated to the entire team) after an intercept try completed a convincing win for Leinster 
and sent O'Driscoll to his first Heineken Cup final.[22] Leinster captured the Heineken Cup against Leicester Tigers on 23 May 2009. 
The 19–16 Heineken Cup victory included a drop goal from O'Driscoll who was suffering from a shoulder injury.[23]
In the 2010–11 season, O'Driscoll won his second Heineken Cup with Leinster.[24] Having been injured in a Magners League game one week before the final, 
O'Driscoll was a major doubt, but he recovered sufficiently and was named in the starting XV.[25] In the final held at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff on 21 May 2011, 
Leinster came from behind to defeat Northampton 33–22.[24]
In the 2012 Heineken Cup Final O'Driscoll won his third Heineken cup with Leinster. 
They beat Ulster 42–14 in an entertaining battle. Sean O'Brien opened the scoring for Leinster to put them ahead 7–3. At half time the score was 14–6, with Cian Healy scoring the second try for Leinster but there was still a lot to play for. A penalty try was then awarded for Leinster but Ulster pulled a try back from second-row Dan Tuohy. Heinke van der Merwe then settled the game with a try for Leinster and Sean Cronin made sure of Leinster's success.
O'Driscoll said in September 2013, that the 2013–14 season would be his last before retiring.[26]
His final appearance for Leinster, and for any team, was in the 2014 Pro12 Grand Final on 31 May in Leinster's home ground, the RDS in Dublin, 
in which Leinster defeated the Glasgow Warriors 34-12.[27] 
He left the field injured early in the first half to be replaced by Ian Madigan. 
His final act as a rugby player was assisting club captain Leo Cullen - who also finished his career on this day - in lifting the Pro12 trophy[28][29]
