Additionally, it will try to determine whether the right side is a literal, a variable name, an operator expression, or a function call expression.

This is one of the tricky things that you will benefit greatly from getting used to working out when you read (or write) code. In this example, the `square` function is called (twice) before the `sub` function is called, even though the `sub` function comes first when reading the code from left to right. In the following example we will adopt the notation of `add` to indicate that Python has looked up the name `add` and determined that it is a function object."

Since expressions in brackets are evaluated first, `2 * (3-1)` is `4`, and `(1+1)**(5-2)` is `8`. You can also use brackets to make an expression easier to read, as in `(minute * 100) / 60`: in this case, the brackets don’t change the result, but they reinforce that the expression in brackets will be evaluated first.\n",

    "3. *Multiplication* and **both** *division* operators (`/` and `//`) have the same precedence, which is higher than *addition* and *subtraction*, which also have the same precedence. So `2*3-1` yields `5` rather than `4`, and `5-2*2` is `1`, not `6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Operators* with the same precedence are evaluated from left-to-right. In algebra they are said to be left-associative. So in the expression `6-3+2`, the subtraction happens first, yielding `3`. We then add `2` to get the result `5`.

For example, you’ll learn how to write just a very small bit of code to find the 1047th character in a sentence that might be thousands of letters long, and you’ll learn how to perform the very same computation on many different pieces of data.\n",
